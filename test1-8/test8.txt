Pain, without love
Pain, I can't get enough
Pain, I like it rough
'Cause I'd rather feel pain than nothing at all
(by verse22.txt 8)
You're sick of feeling numb
You're not the only one
I'll take you by the hand
And I'll show you a world that you can understand
This life is filled with hurt
When happiness doesn't work
Trust me and take my hand
When the lights go out you will understand
(by verse33.txt 4)
Anger and agony
Are better than misery
Trust me I've got a plan
When the lights go off you will understand
